# APLPhys
Computational physics in APL

## Overview
This project is a preliminary investigation into physics simulations in APL. It is intended to demonstrate APL as a tool for translating algorithms and mathematical formulae into executable code. 

The code is available as Dyalog [\]Link](https://github.com/dyalog/link)-able .apl* files.

### Audience
We hope that this project will appeal to physical science, computing and mathematics students and teachers; researchers in physics and materials science, and those using molecular dynamics in particular; and of course the APL and array programming communities.

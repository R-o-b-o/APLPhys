### Notes on initial development of APLPhys

I looked around a few places to find simple examples of molecular dynamics implementations. This [blog post](http://nznano.blogspot.com/2017/11/molecular-dynamics-in-python.html) by NZNano is helping in the inital development of the pair-wise interparticle potential demos. I have saved the blog post as a complete webpage to this repo in order to preserve it in case the source disappears.
